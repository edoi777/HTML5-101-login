<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
  With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
